# Configuration

## Parameters

- `SMA_SERIALS`

  This value can contain a space separated list of serial numbers for which to capture
  packets

  If you do not have the serial number for your Energy meter, you can run the add-on
  with an empty string. The add-on will now capture a debug packet and print the serial
  number found in that packet at the end of the log.

  Fill the number into `SMA_SERIALS` and run the addon again.

- `MQTT_*`

  You will need a working MQTT sevrer since all values will be sent via MQTT.
  The default configuration assumes the Mosquitto broker add-on and you simply have to
  fill in the password you configured there.

- `FIELDS`

  These can be any value supported by the SMA-EM library. A list of options can be found
  [below](*available-sensors)

- `DEBUG`

  The values received will continuously be printed to the add-on's log. This will confirm
  that you receive values for sensor `FIELDS` you configured.

  Recommended value: 0

The following list contains all possible `FIELD` names that you can use with the add-on

## Home Assistant Filters & utility meter

The values from the SMA sensor is updated every 5 seconds and this might fill up your
database fairly quickly.

Below is an example to reduce the frequency for these updates.

Assume `FIELDS=pconsume,pconsumecounter,u1`, and the auto-discovered sensors have been
renamed according to the table below

| Original name   | New name            | Description                     |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| pconsume        | sma_grid_power_5s   | average power (W) last 1 minute |
| pconsumecounter | sma_grid_total_5s   | Total kWh value every 5 minutes |
| u1              | sma_grid_voltage_5s | average voltage last 30s        |

The utility meter will record these values and give you total energy used (kWh) every
day and every month.

Example filters & utility meter configuration.

      - filter: time_simple_moving_average

  - platform: filter
    name: SMA Grid Total

    filters:
      - filter: time_throttle
        window_size: 00:05

  - platform: filter
    name: SMA Grid Voltage
    entity_id: sensor.sma_grid_voltage_5s
    filters:
